# HTTP Workflows

In this guide, we'll take a look at a workflow that can receive HTTP requests, send HTTP requests and write output to the HTTP response object. Our workflow will handle inbound HTTP requests, invoke a backend API using an HTTP call, and write back the response to the client. As a result, we will learn how to use the following HTTP activities:

* HttpEndpoint
* SendHttpRequest
* WriteHttpResponse
* SetVariable
