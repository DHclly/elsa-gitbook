# Elsa Workflows

Elsa Workflows is a powerful and flexible execution engine, encapsulated as a set of open-source .NET libraries designed to infuse .NET applications with workflow capabilities. With Elsa, developers can weave logic directly into their systems, enhancing functionality and automation and align seamlessly with the applicationâ€™s core functionality.

Workflows in Elsa can be defined in two ways:

* Programmatically: By writing .NET code, developers can define complex workflows tailored to specific business needs.
* Visually: Using the built-in designer, non-developers or those who prefer a visual approach can create and modify workflows with ease.
