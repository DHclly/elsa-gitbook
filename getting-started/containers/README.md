# Containers

Elsa not only allows for the integration of its packages into custom .NET applications, but also offers prebuilt Docker images for ease of deployment. These images come in various configurations tailored to different needs, such as the standalone Elsa Server for API-based workflow execution, Elsa Studio for a user-friendly design interface, and a combined setup that integrates both Elsa Server and Studio.&#x20;
